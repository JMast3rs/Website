                <h1>Mitigating Personal Exposure on the web.</h1>

                <h2>Introduction.</h2> In this literature review, I will be looking at different parts of cyber security. More specifically how people can make themselves more secure and how they can stop people from getting a hold of their information. One of the other topics
                I will be looking at is how people can use information which they have obtained from a user to get certain privileges so as a result they can steal either information or money. Cyber security is one of the biggest problems that the world
                should be dealing with because of the ever-increasing user base and information gathering skills.
                <h2>Understanding the risks of exposure of your information on the web.</h2>
                <h2>Social Engineering.</h2> In an article, I read it was talking about how social engineering is considered a “low-tech attack” on a user, this is because how you use a person to get access to information rather than using your computer. In the article, they talk
                about how it is designed for “manipulating victims to divulge confidential information and is successful in its attempt due to exploiting personality vulnerabilities.”. It also points out how “sophisticated IT security systems cannot protect
                systems from hackers or defend against what seems to be authorised access.”, This means that the hacker is manipulating a person who already has access to the information they are trying to get a hold of and so as a result is bypassing
                any normal security measure (Conteh & Schmick, 2016).
                <h2>How interesting/enticing titles are used to lure users in.</h2> This is one of the main ways that social engineering is used. You can make a link that will infect a computer, but how do you get a user to click on it. We mostly see this on websites that want you to click on their advertisements and
                that is why they use such outrageous or very unlikely subjects. So that they get your attention and you wanting to know more about this subject. A survey “conducted by TNS Global for Halon” said that “30 percent of the surveyed populace
                comprised of 1,000 adults in the U.S. disclosed that they would open an email even if they were aware it contained a virus” (Conteh & Schmick, 2016). This study shows that people do not take cyber security as serious as it is because they
                are willing to compromise information that they have access to just because they are unwilling to see the signs that this could be a hazard.
                <h2>Understanding how common attacks work.</h2>
                <h2>How Phishing works.</h2> Phishing is when you “obtain personal information” e.g. name, address and “personal identifiable information (PII)”. Fishing is a targeted attack on a customer of a selected bank or service. This is so the hacker can “embed links to redirect
                users to suspicious websites that appear legitimate”. The links may be embedded in emails or text messages which look like they are from the service and that is why you need to make sure that they use in a verified email or is from a number
                that’s your service is known to use. These websites will look like the services normal webpage but are in fact hosted on a completely different server and will have a completely different address but will get you to enter sensitive information
                like passwords and usernames. The hackers will also make it seem like the information is time sensitive so that they can create “a sense of urgency to manipulate users to act in a manner that challenges good judgement.”. Meaning that they
                are getting them to enter information without them thinking or realising what they are doing (Conteh & Schmick, 2016). Victims of such attacks are normally wise to the scheme but the “assumption that it would not happen to them” makes
                such knowledge useless (Shillair et al., 2015).
                <h2>Quid pro quo.</h2> Quid pro quo is more of a social engineering attack compared with phishing. This is because a more of a personal exposure to the hacker is used. The attack is done by someone normally “offering assistance” and the victim is normally “experiencing
                technical challenges” (Conteh & Schmick, 2016). Using the hackers point of power over the victim they use this to gain information. Normally at this point the hacker has full control over the victim’s computer and now can install malware
                so they can monitor all of the victims activities.
                <h2>Understanding what you can do to prevent falling for attacks.</h2>
                <h2>Your information exposure.</h2> With a very high percentage of people using social media currently, means that hackers have a huge amount of basic information on people which they can easily access. A survey by “Pew Internet and American Life Project” shows that people
                post their “year of birth (50%), email address (46%), employer (44%)”. This “excessive sharing of information” shows that Internet users have a “lack of deep understanding” of how this type of data can be used to manipulate them. It also
                shows that Internet users give “little effort to protect one’s self online”, which is a big worry for police and cyber prevention agencies.
                <h2>Preventing purposeful exposure of information.</h2> Educating users may be the best way to get users to understand why having your information open to the public is not secure. “Even with robust campaigns conveying the dangers of opening suspicious emails” are still not effective because
                “a large majority of email users remain vulnerable”. Some companies have had success with “adding multiple layers to their security scheme”. So that if one layer of security failed the second could have a chance to come into place (Conteh
                & Schmick, 2016).
                <h2>Conclusion.</h2> From this you can see that the average user has a lot to contend with on the World Wide Web and so should be very careful, but with training and knowledge they can become a lot more secure on the Internet. This may be very difficult for
                people because of how they will have to change their Internet habits and in years to come this will play a much bigger factor as our lives get even more integrated with technology. So hopefully with this I have covered why it is important
                not to have your information available, how information can be taken from you and how you can prevent this from happening to you.
