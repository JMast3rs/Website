                <h3>Web Security</h3>
                In this week's task we have been looking a security. This is following on from lecture which Dr Nick Savages gave. This is from are practical task where me and a partner have to identify different types of information. Information that
                you generate on a day to day basis.
                <h4>Connectivity to Wifi networks.i</h4>
                <li>By connecting to an wifi network, information such as when you connected is recorded in addition to when you connected. In most cases location data is also logged in so that applications are able to use your location when carrying tasks.
                    E.g. google maps, uber etc. The type of device is also recorded * (most likely for security purposes)</li>
                <h4>Library</h4>
                <li>When you enter the Library and scan your ID so that they know that you are allowed in, they also record the time you entered. This is so that there know who is in the Library at anytime. You uses your ID to take books out and so they know
                    what books you have out, if any are overdue.</li>
                <h4>Location based applications</h4>
                <li>Applications such as google maps, uber and snapchat all utilise the userâ€™s location to provide a tailor based service. The information is captured when user agrees to allow the application to use their location. This information is collected
                    from the gps signal from the user's phone.</li>
                <h4>Login to university computers.</h4>
                <li>When looking into any of the University computer you have to enter your Username and Password. This is so they can check that you are allowed access to the computer and can access your N drive and load your Chrome settings, there will
                    want to record who was using the computer so if anything is broken with it there can look who was the last one using it.</li>
                <h4>Metadata</h4>
                <li>Google knows when you enter a shop, purchase an item and will offer you deals based on what products you have purchased recently or in the past. If you use Android Pay and will ask you for a review.</li>

                <h1>Week 1</h1>
                <h3>Introduction</h3> One of our first tasks was to set up a virtual machine which I had already done in my database practical and so I had already had experience with starting the machine up. This VM will be very useful because it will allow me to easily
                make a web server which can host all different types of softwares without having to fiddle with round with my laptop/desktop. Our next task was to get the coursework from moodle and put it in are Google Drive and star it. this is so that
                we have the coursework on hand and so that we do not leave it to the last minute. I also read through the coursework so that I understood what I would have to be doing throughout the year. the first coursework is the literary write up
                and my lecturer talked about this in are lecture. I will be waiting till next week for Dr Nick Savages lecture before I start writing any of this. Our next task was to go on a Google forms and fill out what we thought was the best and
                worst websites, this was very interesting because it showed how people use the Internet and really made me think what a bad website looks like. the website I put for the most useful was Google and this is quite obvious as it is the biggest
                search engine which I use for my emails Word Documents and cloud storage. I spend lots of hours a week on Google and other of their services. When speaking to people most people agreed that the worst website is a website that is structured
                badly is out of date and does not display the information that you need. Our next task was to choose a editor and I have used notepad++ for many years and so that is what I decide to use as I think it is simple but has lots of key features
                like command highlighting so that you can separate different functions when programming in this program. Our next task was to do a bit further Reading and I had a look through the information security principles PDF that was provided on
                Moodle it is very interesting and will help me locked in my literary write up.
